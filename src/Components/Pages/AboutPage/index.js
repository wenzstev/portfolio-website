        Hi, I'm Steve! I'm a Full Stack Developer living in Brooklyn.
        I graduated in 2017 from Washington University in St. Louis with a minor
        in Computer Science, and I've been coding seriously since September 2019.
        These days I primarily code in Python and JavaScript. I started a <a href="https://wenzstev.github.io">blog</a> back in January, where
        I've been writing about my development journey and the challenges I've faced in
        making my various projects.
      </Typography>
      <Typography className={classes.body} style={bodyStyle}>
        In my free time, I've been trying to make the best of COVID with an assortment of
        hobbies, including cooking and baking, development, and writing. My favorite kind of
        project is one where I can involve my other hobbies; both SousChef and Easy Draft
        stemmed from a desire to do something with cooking and writing, respectively.
      </Typography>
      <Typography className={classes.body} style={bodyStyle}>
